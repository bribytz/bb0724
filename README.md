### Assumptions
- rental day count is inclusive of checkout day. 

### Things/ Questions
- Warning on number of days if greater than X days (so if they enter 100 instead of 10, they'd get a warning, but that'd probably happen on the UI)
- Date validation so that past checkouts can't happen
    - or if this did need to happen, maybe lock this to an admin/supervisor role
- Can a tool be returned on one of the two holidays?
